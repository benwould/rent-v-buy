# rent-v-buy


We been hired as a Fitech data analyst at FTX . We will have to determine where to move to next. FTX has offices in 10 cities across the US. We get to select one to move too, the question is which one makes the most fiscal sense to move to. We need to determine if we should purchase a home with a mortgage or rent their new home in your selected city.

To help determine what you should do use our Rent-v-Buy module to use current housing data and your personal imputs to determine if you shoudl Rent or Purchase you new home in your city of choice. In order to make the best choice you will be presented with the accrued equity in a mortgage of your home purchase and your cost incurred from Renting a home for your selected amount of years.
